The auther also gave some explaination about some of concepts to help reader to better understand the paper. In the second part of the paper, Cooper briefly discussed the structure of the belief network. He said a belief network structure is consisted by three conponents which are truth-setting, clasuse-satisfaction-testing and overall-satisfaction-testing. And the clause-satisfaction-testing component brings another concept which is one of the Boolean satisfiability problem called 3SAT. Cooper introduced this concept on section 4 and explained how components influence each others.  \n",
